PySplit
=======

Program for splitting and formatting python code from classes like Udacity's CS 101

    Requirements: 
    + Files should be saved in the same folder or subdirectory.
    + Lessons/Chapters/Topics should be saved as separate files, if they are not the counters will be off.
    + Comment lines must begin with #, and questions must be posted as comments.
    + Each question - solution pair is separated with a single line starting with !
    +  Code, spaces, or tab characters must precede comments that are to be included within the code.
    
    Instructions:
    + To create files for converting, copy over all the questions and answers from a section into a single file,
      making sure that between each question a single line starting with an exclamation (!) is added. 
      Save this as a text file.
    + When the program runs, it will ask you to select a directory. This directory should contain only text files
      you want to have parsed. The program will parse every text file in that directory and create three new directories:
      Questions, Solutions, & Reddit.
    + To select a single file, exit first prompt window and a file selector window will appear.
    + To modify saving behavior, adjust the corresponding variable settings in the source.
